## Introduction
Inter-individual variability in drug metabolism can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs), toxicity or reduced therapy efficacy. Inherited genetic variants in drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters can explain up to 50% of this variability. Since the occurrence or frequency of the genetic variants in worldwide population shows ethnical and geographical differences, a detailed map visualizing these differences can help to identify regions, countries or subpopulations on risk for ADRs or lack of drug efficacy.

## Application
This is a shiny app to visualize genetic variability across worldwide populations of clinically important pharmacogenes according to https://www.pharmgkb.org/. Detailed methods are included within the app. 

To run the app view the newest "stable" version on shinyapps.io:
